# Tutorial 7.2: application of the M-SSA to quarterly macro-data

# The previous tutorial 7.1 demonstrates asymptotic convergence of the relevant performance numbers to 
#   expected values (as derived in the M-SSA paper), assuming knowledge of the data generating process (DGP)
# -Tutorial 7.1 checks the theory

# In contrast, we here have relatively short (in-sample) spans and we (have to) allow for (and address) 
#   model misspecification

# Purposes of this tutorial:
# -Apply the M-SSA to quarterly (German) macro-data during insecure times 
#   -Tutorials 7.1-7.3 were written early 2025 and rely on data up to Jan-2025
#   -The HP-filter signals a severe on-going (and worsening) recession, see exercise 4 below
#     -Germany endures a recession: we observe negative BIP-growth since several quarters
#   -Can we use M-SSA to predict future BIP dynamics: what are the prospects for 2025 and 2026?
# -Analyze various designs for nowcasting and forecasting German GDP (BIP:=Brutto Inland Produkt)
# -Analyze effects of model misspecifications (the VAR(1) cannot render recessions properly)
# -Infer possible solutions for eluding model misspecification issues and analyze their efficacity
# -Provide an empirical background and basic insights to understand the various forecast designs 
#   proposed in tutorial 7.3 

# Some background information:
# -As discussed in tutorial 7.1, we do not deliver `GDP numbers' ("give me the number")
#   -Such a `number' would be subject to a forecast interval whose width would invariably invalidate its 
#     relevance. 
#   -Forecasting GDP `numbers' is almost surely (with probability one) a futile exercise, 
#     at least in a multi-step  ahead perspective (several quarters ahead)
# -We here focus on looking ahead (sensing) the future growth dynamics as contained (but masked/hidden) 
#     in present-day data: we try to `extract the minute signal` and `skip the dominating noise'
#   -The reliance in a `signal' may be anchored in the concept of `business cycle'
#   -In his talk at the University of Chicagoâ€™s Booth School of Business (March 07, 2025), FED-chair Jerome Powell 
#       said: "As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise 
#       as the outlook evolves", suggesting in his talk that the FED should not (over)react to noise.
#   -Similarly, a forecast procedure should not be reactive to `noise'
#   -However, when targeting BIP in its entirety, including its noisy part, classic direct forecasts are 
#     subject to overfitting, mainly because the components that dominate the MSE (the erratic 
#     high-frequency pulses) distract the OLS optimization from fitting the (much weaker) systematic dynamics  
# -M-SSA in this application is about dynamic aspects of prediction: 
#     -M-SSA emphasizes the target correlation, thereby ignoring `static' level and scale adjustments (calibration), needed to generate GDP `numbers' 
#     -We derive predictors which do not emphasize unilaterally a mean-square error metric (we already know the outcome of doing so)
#       -Instead, M-SSA emphasizes ALSO left-shift/lead/advancement and smoothness (few false alarms): AST trilemma
# -We try to address questions like: 
#   -Did we reach the bottom of the current recession in Germany (based on data up to Jan-2025)? 
#     -The HP filter suggests that we did not, see exercise 4 below
#   -Is the economy currently recovering (Jan 2025)?
#   -Can we expect to reach above long-term growth in foreseeable time? 
# -To be clear: don't ask for a `number'
#   -In our plots, predictors are standardized and positive/negative readings suggest above/below 
#     long-term growth
#   -M-SSA controls the rate of zero-crossings, i.e., the rate of crossings of the predictors above or 
#     below long-term average growth
#   -Therefore we can control for the number of noisy (false) alarms (signaling below or above long-term growth)
# -BIP `numbers' could be obtained by calibration of the standardized M-SSA predictors on BIP
#   -Determine optimal static level and scale adjustments by linear regression

# The tutorial is structured into four exercises
# -Exercise 1 discusses important design decisions (target specification) and applies M-SSA to the data
#   -Unfortunately, the VAR(1) model is subject to misspecification resulting in poor performances
# -Exercise 2 will analyze the (main) causes of misspecification and propose solutions to overcome undesirable consequences
# -Exercise 3 combines all ingredients to propose a recipe for constructing the M-SSA BIP predictors
# -Exercise 4 compares our results with the HP-filter
#   -M-SSA contradicts HP (and the future will tell)

# Start with a clean sheet
rm(list=ls())

# Let's start by loading the required R-libraries

# Standard filter package
library(mFilter)
# Multivariate time series: VARMA model for macro indicators: used here for simulation purposes only
library(MTS)
# HAC estimate of standard deviations in the presence of autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity
library(sandwich)


# Load the relevant M-SSA functionalities
# M-SSA functions
source(paste(getwd(),"/R/functions_MSSA.r",sep=""))
# Load signal extraction functions used for JBCY paper (relies on mFilter)

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 1: apply M-SSA to quarterly German Macro-data

# 1.1. Load data and select indicators
# 1.1.1 We first look at the original files: BIP `numbers` refer to this data
data_file_name<-c("Data_HWI_2025_02.csv","gdp_2025_02.csv")
# Monthly data: note that ip is generally not available up to sample end (publication lag)
data_monthly<-read.csv(paste(getwd(),"/Data/",data_file_name[1],sep=""))
tail(data_monthly)
# Quarterly data: BIP in the first data column
data_quarterly<-read.csv(paste(getwd(),"/Data/",data_file_name[2],sep=""))
tail(data_quarterly)

# 1.1.2 We do not work with original (unprocessed) data
# -Instead we apply the following transformation steps
#   -Log-transform (to positive series) 
#   -Quarterly differences (to emphasize growth)
#   -Standardization: series are zero-centered and scaled to unit variance 
#   -Trimming: the singular Covid-data is trimmed (we trim to 3 sigma, as can be observed in the following plot) 
# -In summary, the `numbers' that will be plotted in the following figure seemingly do not relate to the original data
#   -After transformation, the numbers are not interpretable in terms of GDP or industrial production
# -But the transformations help in extracting the minute signal from the overwhelming noise by M-SSA
# -If explicitly needed, forecasts could be traced-back to original `numbers' by straightforward inverse transformations

# We proceeded to the above sequence of transformations and selected a couple of series deemed (very) important
#   -The transformed data is provided in the following macro data-file
load(file=paste(getwd(),"\\Data\\macro",sep=""))
tail(data)
# Remarks on the format of the data file:
# -Series are standardized
# -The target column (first one) in the above file refers to the series to which the target filter will be applied
#   -BIP forward-shifted by the publication lag
# -All subsequent columns correspond to the explanatory data available in January 2025 for nowcasting or 
#     forecasting the target
#   -BIP in the second column is an explanatory variable: it is lagged by two quarters relative to the target 
#     column (BIP is subject to a publication lag)
# -A nowcast of BIP means that we compute an estimate of the output of the two-sided HP-filter when 
#   applied to the first (target) column. 
# -A forecast at horizon h=4 (one year) means that we shift forward by one additional year the target
   

# Remarks on the publication lag
# -BIP has a publication lag of one quarter actually 
#   -But we shifted the data in the target column one additional quarter upwards (forward) to be on the 
#     safe-side (for example to account for data revisions, which are ignored here)
# -Keep in mind this feature of our design: performances at a forecast horizon of three quarters in our plots 
#   might be indicative of performances a full year ahead, as well


# Let's now specify the publication lag: 2 quarters for BIP in the target column
#   -This lag will be used extensively when shifting the target forward
#   -We shall always add lag_vec[1] to the forecast horizon to obtain the effective forward-shift
lag_vec<-c(2,rep(0,ncol(data)-1))

# Plot the data:
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
mplot<-data
colo<-c("black",rainbow(ncol(data)-1))
main_title<-paste("Quarterly design BIP: the target (black) assumes a publication lag of ",lag_vec[1]," Quarters",sep="")
plot(mplot[,1],main=main_title,axes=F,type="l",xlab="",ylab="",col=colo[1],lwd=c(2,rep(1,ncol(data)-1)),ylim=c(min(na.exclude(mplot)),max(na.exclude(mplot))))

# Comments:
# -The explanatory variables BIP (red line) and ip (orange) are right shifted (peaks/dips appear one quarter later)
#   -Publication lags: BIP one quarter and ip two months, see tail(data_monthly)
# -The explanatory variable BIP (red) is lagging the target BIP (black) by lag_vec[1]=2 quarters 
# -The figure suggests that our selection of the publication lag might be too large since the target column
#     anticipates peaks and dips of the other series by one quarter during crises (the target is left-shifted)
# -This excessive shift gives us some safety-margin regarding data revisions (which are ignored here)
# -The series are standardized to account for the different scales of the data
# -Pandemic is trimmed to 3 sigma (the trimming affects also the financial crisis but to a much lesser extent)
# Remarks:
# -We use trimming because classic approaches (HP, VAR-model) are sensitive to the singular COVID readings
#   -M-SSA by itself (the optimization algorithm) would be quite robust against the singularity
#   -But M-SSA could be affected indirectly, by the VAR-modeling which is sensitive to the Pandemic outliers 


# Select the macro indicators for predicting the target by M-SSA: 
#   Five dimensional design in accordance with expert feedback

n<-dim(x_mat)[2]
# Number of observations
len<-dim(x_mat)[1]

# Note: the target column is ignored (it is redundant)
#   -In our comparisons we will simply shift the BIP-column upwards by lag_vec[1]+shift, where shift=0 (nowcast) or shift>0 (forecast)
tail(x_mat)
#------------------------------
# 1.2. Target filter: 
# -We apply a filter to the target series (BIP shifted upward by lag_vec[1]+shift quarters) in order to
#   damp noise (the unpredictable high-frequency components of BIP)
# -Main idea (forecast `philosophy'):  removing/damping the unpredictable part (noise) helps in 
#   addressing the predictable portion (signal) of BIP 
#   -As we shall see in tutorial 7.3, statistical significance of predictors can be verified multiple 
#     quarters ahead in this framework
# -Question: which target are we aiming for? 
#   -This choice should support our prospect to forecast BIP multiple quarters ahead
# -The target specification is a difficult problem that requires a comprehensive analysis of the prediction problem:
#   -What is the data looking like?
#   -What are the main purposes (priorities) of the forecast design?

# Note: 
# -The target specification is exogenous to M-SSA 
# -M-SSA assumes that a target has been specified: once done, optimal predictors can be derived
# -The discussion here is not about M-SSA directly, but about an important guide-line, telling M-SSA 
#   what signal to look for

# Back to the selection of an appropriate target:
# -The HP-filter has some interesting (not well-known) properties, see tutorial 2 
# -The classic quarterly design assumes an HP(1600) with lambda=1600
# -However HP(1600) alters relevant information: for example by smoothing out narrow recession dips
#   -See a corresponding critic by Phillips and Jin (2021), suggesting that HP(1600) is `too smooth' (insufficiently flexible)
#   -Dynamic changes as obtained by HP(1600) are too weak (too smooth) to be `useful' in our forecast context (dynamic changes of HP(1600) over a one-year horizon are weak)
#   -As a result, left-shifts (anticipations) of the M-SSA predictor as a function of the forecast horizon 
#        cannot be obtained effectively 
#   -Also, HP(1600) seems (more) sensitive to the Pandemic: the finite-length truncated filter looks `terrible'
# -To summarize
#   -We here select a more adaptive HP(160) design (tutorial 7.3 will explore even more adaptive settings)
#   -HP(160) is able to track narrow recession dips `better': it is also able to track the Euro-Area (sovereign debt) crisis 
#   -HP(160) is able to track dynamic shifts occurring within a one-year horizon better than HP(1600)
# -Overall, we prefer HP(160) as a target specification for this application

lambda_HP<-160
# Filter length: roughly 4 years. 
#   The length should be an odd number, see tutorial 7.1 for background (mirroring of right tail to obtain two-sided target in M-SSA)
L<-31
# Compute the filter: we rely on the mFilter R-package in the following wrapper

gamma_target=t(target_obj$gamma_target)
symmetric_target=target_obj$symmetric_target 
colnames(gamma_target)<-select_vec_multi


# We plot the right tails of the target filter (the left tails will be obtained by `mirroring', see tutorial 7.1)
#   -To each series of the multivariate design, we assign a target, namely the two-sided HP applied to this series, see tutorial 7.1
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
ts.plot(gamma_target,col=rainbow(n),main="Target filters: the right tails will be mirrored to obtain the two-sided target")
abline(v=1+(1:n)*L)

# We tell M-SSA to mirror the right tail of the HP (as shown in the above figure) at the center peak: 
#   symmetric_target==T (Boolean is true)

# This means that the effective target will by the two-sided filter

# 1.3. Fit the VAR
# Select any in-sample span: the effect on the final M-SSA predictor is modest
#   -The VAR is sparsely parametrized  (p=1 and regularization)
# Set in-sample span: full set
date_to_fit<-"2200"
# Set in-sample span: prior Pandemic
date_to_fit<-"2019"
# Set in-sample span: prior financial crisis: this is the one we select here

#---------------------------------------
# 1.4. MA inversion: as in the (univariate) SSA, we need to specify the data generating process (DGP) to M-SSA 
# -For this purpose we rely on the Wold decomposition of the DGP: MA-inversion of the above VAR
# -A plot should pop-up in the plot-panel, after running the next code line, illustrating the MA-inversion
#   -An MA-inversion is obtained for each of the five series used in the multivariate design
# -The MA-inversion can be used to interpret the VAR: 
#   -Large weights of series j for series i mean that series j is an important explanatory variable for series i 
#   -The rate of decay of the weights is indicative about the memory of the data generating process
#   -The plot also discloses leads or lags (the peak of spread is generally right-shifted)
#   -In principle, the MA-weights should reflect the previous acf-plot `somehow'

# We see that the concept of `excess forecast' leads to a commensurate left-shift of M-SSA-excess (red)
# This left-shift is responsible for the improvement seen in the sample target correlations
#   -If the true process were the fitted VAR(1), then we would probably not observe the marked recession dips
#   -Therefore, the obtained left-shift would not improve performances (quite the opposite in fact)
#   -But in the presence of strong asymmetric down-turns, a `faster' filter can track the relevant dynamics better 

# By the way: we see that both predictors bottomed-out around late 2023 and are now reverting 
#   towards average growth (zero-line)
# Notes:
# -The trough (minimum) of the grow-rate (plotted above) anticipates the trough of BIP by up to several quarters
# -The timing of the BIP-trough is sandwiched between the trough and the next zero-crossing of the growth-rate 


# Findings:
# -We can address misspecification of the VAR(1) (for data with marked recession episodes) by:
#   1. allowing for a stronger left-shift of the predictor (excess forecast) and by
#   2. allowing for a re-scaling (calibration) of the left-shifted predictor, which is typically subject 
#         to excessive zero-shrinkage
# We now apply these findings towards the construction of predictors for German GDP (BIP)

# Exercise 3: construction of (standardized) M-SSA BIP predictors

# -M-SSA generates five outputs: for BIP, ip, ifo, ESI and spread
# -We now propose a construction in three steps for the M-SSA BIP predictors
# A. Equal-weighting
# -We consider each of the five M-SSA outputs as an equally valid and informative predictor for future BIP
# -Therefore we aggregate all five predictors equally, assuming that each one was previously standardized
#   -Cross-sectional aggregation: equal weighting
# B. Forecast excess
# -We select a larger delta than strictly necessary if the VAR were true (forecast-excess, see exercise 2)  
# C. Forecast horizons:
# -We compute M-SSA predictors based on A. and B. above, targeting BIP at horizons 0 (nowcast), 1, 2, 4 (one year) and 6 quarters ahead
#   -We then compute performances of each of the five predictors relative to BIP shifted by 0,1,2,4,6 quarters: 
#       -We consider all 5*5=25 combinations
#   -We also consider statistical significance, by relying on different statistics (using HAC estimates of variances)

#################################################################
# Summary and main findings
# -When targeting forecast horizons of a year or less, we need to focus on signals (HP-trends) 
#   which allow for sufficient adaptivity (sufficiently strong dynamics over such a time interval) 
#   -For this purpose we selected lambda_HP=160 
#   -The increased adaptivity forces predictors to react to the forecast horizon by a commensurate left-shift (anticipation)
#   -In tutorial 7.3 we shall look at even more adaptive designs
# -Assuming a suitable choice for lambda_HP, the main construction principles behind M-SSA indicators leads to 
#     forecast designs with predictive relevance
#   -Timeliness: The left-shift can be controlled by the forecast horizon
#   -Smoothness: noise-suppression (zero-crossings)) can be controlled effectively by the HT constraint
# -Model misspecification (of the VAR) can be addressed by imposing a forecast `excess' to M-SSA
# -Predicting HP-BIP (the trend component) seems easier than predicting BIP
#   -HP-BIP is fairly exempted from erratic (unpredictable) high-frequency components of BIP
# -The effect of the forecast horizon (hyperparameter) is statistically (and logically) consistent: 
#   -Increasing the forecast horizon leads to improved performances at larger forward-shifts
#   -The forecast horizon is commensurate to the observed `physical' forward-shift of the target 
# -Performances with respect to BIP (instead of HP-BIP) are less conclusive, due in part to unpredictable high-frequency noise
#   -However, the link between the forecast horizon and the physical-shift is still recognizable
#   -More aggressive settings for the forecast excess may reinforce these findings (up to a point)
# -Finally, a predictor of the low-frequency component of (future) HP-BIP is potentially informative about 
#     future BIP (if the latter is not white noise).
