# -In the previous tutorials 7.2 and 7.3 we illustrated that M-SSA can effectively `look-ahead' by being 
#   increasingly left-shifted (advanced or leading) for increasing forecast horizon
# -We also demonstrated that the HT can be used to control the smoothness (HT)
# -Prediction trilemma: left-shift, HT and MSE performances, see e.g. tutorials 0.1 and 2.1
#   -We can always improve one or even two constituents of the trilemma at costs of the remaining one(s) 
# -We here illustrate the multivariate M-SSA trilemma by exploring the hyperparameter-space defined by HT and delta (forecast horizon)
